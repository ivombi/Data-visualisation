# Project and data description
## Background
Nigerian states in North East, North Central, and South South have been the most affected by conflicts and violences. Conflict and violence in North East Nigeria is primarily attributable to Boko Haram, the terrorist group responsible for human rights abuses across Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, and Niger. The violent radicalization of the Boko Haram members and the resulting military operations have reportedly affected nearly fifteen million people since 2009. The south south of Nigeria is renowned for its oil wealth. Militant and pirate groups have operated in the region for decades, targeting oil companies, pipelines, and individuals. Killings, abductions, and robberies are not uncommon, and many people have been displaced from their homes or communities as a result of the violence. In recent years, conflict in the North Central zone has both escalated and expanded as tensions between farmers and herders have risen. The conflict centers around agricultural households and nomadic cattle-herding groups whocome into conflict over land access

## Research Questions
The objectives of this project is to use visualizations to response to the following questions:
 > - How is the conflicts and violence distributed across Nigeria?
 > - Are these conflicts and violence across Nigeria by the different actors related?
 > - Do the different actors or arm groups have territorial interest?
 > - Is there a possibility to predict future violence in certain regions by certain arm groups?
 > -  Which are the regions that can be mapped as danger zones for tourists?
